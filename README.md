# ARcademy---Augmented-Reality

ARcademy - Augmented Reality Project

Project Overview:
ARcademy is an augmented reality (AR) based project developed using Unity game development software. This project leverages AR technology to create interactive and educational experiences in two key areas:

1. Medical Education: The project aims to educate individuals in the medical field through immersive 3D content. Using Unity 3D and AR, users can visualize complex medical concepts in a more engaging and interactive manner.
